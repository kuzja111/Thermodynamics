**Curriculum Module**

_Created with R2024a. Compatible with R2024a and later releases._

# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach fundamental concepts and basic terminology related to introductory thermodynamics. Topics addressed include units, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, state variables, work, and the components of a refrigeration cycle. 

## Background

You can use these live scripts as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. This module consists of several interactive live scripts intended to introduce or deepen student understanding of thermodynamic concepts, including working with data tables and reading thermodynamic plots. Two additional scripts are included for instructors or students who want to go beyond the included material by installing CoolProp or building their own refrigerator model. 


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/EndIcon.png" width="19" alt="EndIcon.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.


Solutions are available upon instructor request. Contact the [MathWorks online teaching team](mailto:%20onlineteaching@mathworks.com) if you would like to request solutions or have a question.

## Prerequisites

These scripts assume background knowledge of common thermodynamic terminology covered in secondary education, such as temperature, pressure, kinetic energy, and potential energy. Some scripts also require fluency with basic integral calculus. There is minimal MATLAB knowledge required for FirstLaw, SecondLaw and StatePlots, but you could use [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted) as a resource to acquire familiarity with live scripts and MATLAB syntax. More familiarity with MATLAB is required for CreatePVplots, CalculateWork, and Model\_Fridge, as those are designed in Code Visible format. Familiarity with Simulink at the level of [Simulink Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/simulink-onramp/simulink) may be helpful for Model\_Fridge as well.


For those interested in additional coding, SetUpCoolProp includes instructions for installing and accessing CoolProp. BuildRefrigerator walks through a project to build a refrigerator model in Simulink out of standard component blocks. BuildRefrigerator requires [Simulink Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/simulink-onramp/simulink), at a minimum. If possible, [Simscape Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/simscape-onramp/simscape) would be helpful as well. Students are expected to find and insert specified blocks, connect blocks, edit block parameters, rename blocks, copy and paste subsystems, run simulations, and explore the output.

## Getting Started

**On MATLAB Online:**


Use the [<img src="Images/OpenInMO.png" width="136" alt="OpenInMO.png">](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Thermodynamics&project=Thermodynamics.prj&file=README.mlx) link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see README.mlx laying out the contents of the repository.


**On Desktop:**


Ensure you have all the required products (listed below) installed. If you need to include a product, add it using the Add\-On Explorer. To install an add\-on, go to the **Home** tab and select  <img src="Images/AddOnsIcon.png" width="16" alt="AddOnsIcon.png"> **Add-Ons** > **Get Add-Ons**. Then open Thermodynamics.prj to set up the project. The project will be loaded, and you will see README.mlx laying out the contents of the repository.


**Working through the module:**


Get started with each topic by clicking the link to open the live script. The instructions inside each live script will walk you through the live script and related functions.
